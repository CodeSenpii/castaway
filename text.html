<p>It was 3 a.m. I was on a <span data-content="T i' nee">tiny</span> <span data-content="sh ip">ship</span> in the <span data-content="mid d L">middle </span>of the <span>ocean</span> working for a Team of
Ocean Explorers with my crew mates Bill, Josh, and Joe the captain. We were about to
launch the underwater submarine when a big wave smashed</p>

<p>against the side of our boat sending me overboard. My life preserver immediately
   inflated upon contact with water.What was that? It wasn't supposed to be stormy today,
  I yelled. The forecast said it would be clear and calm until 6 p.m. but as they say, </p>

<p>“The weather forecast could be wrong.” However, most likely it was a rogue wave which
   can travel hundreds of miles across the ocean and capsize unsuspecting boats. I
   couldn't think about that right now and needed to focus on survival. First,</p>

<p>I tried looking around for the lights of the boat but it was completely dark.
   The boat crew and captain would be looking around and yelling for me but I
   couldn't hear anything.Then out of nowhere something came flying at me and knocked</p>

<p>me unconscious. I feel the warm ocean water around my feet and sand between my lips.
   The hot sun beating against my skin began to sting. I sat up and rubbed my head.
   I felt a sharp pain; something solid must have hit my head.</p>

 <p>By some miracle I am still alive and very thankful for that. I tried to stand
   up but couldn’t; my legs felt like rubber. I looked out over the ocean from the
   beach and all I could see was nothing but empty sea. Not a single ocean going vessel in sight.</p>

 <p>As I gradually got my strength back I began to look around the island from
   the beach…nothing but trees. No sign of life anywhere save for a few crabs and birds.
    A sense of panic came over me. How am I going to survive? Before long my </p>

<p>training kicked in. Before going out to sea, the entire crew of the ship had to
   take a survival class just in case something like this happened. The first thing
    I must do  is to assess my physical condition. Apart from the sharp pain on</p>

<p>the right side of my head everything else seems fine. I took a quick inventory of
   everything I had; One watch and one utility knife strapped to my waist and my team's
    ocean explorer suit with life preserver. The knife is something I used </p>

<p>around the boat all the time which is why I had it secured to my person…lucky me.
   The next thing is to establish shelter in a safe place free of dangerous wildlife;
    to do that I need to do some exploring. It was early in the morning according</p>

<p>to my watch so I have all day to look around the area. Brrrrrrrrrr ! my stomach
  began to growl. A wave of hunger swept over me. Before I go exploring I need to get
   some food. It didn't take long before I found some coconuts, almond fruit and sea </p>

<p>berries which were plentiful. I also found a conch in the shallows which can be eaten raw.
After my meal I felt 100 times better and my morale lifted. Feeling fully energized I set out
 to find a good spot to shelter. After 3 hours of searching </p>

<p>I found a good spot to set up my camp. It was a big rock with a small cave just big
   enough for one person. The floor of the cave was filled with small pebbles and perfect
    for a makeshift bed. From the front of the cave I can see clearly out </p>

<p>onto the vast ocean which is important to see any passing boats I can signal.
  I immediately got to work preparing my camp. I gathered enough wood and palm
  leaves to make a comfortable sleeping area. Using the excess wood I gathered</p>

<p>to make a signal fire pile. I found empty soda cans, the bottom of which can
   be used to make a sunlight reflector which can be seen from miles away by
   passing sea boats or aircrafts. It will be night soon and I become overwhelmed by sleep.</p>

<p>My stomach growled but I was too tired to care. My eyes closed as soon as I fell onto
   the makeshift bed. The next day I woke up early, my watch said 6:04am. A small
   pool of fresh water formed in a small natural catchment area of the cave.</p>

<p> It must have rained last night. The pool of fresh water was a life saver. I drank
  directly from the pool of water and saved as much of it as I could in plastic jugs
  I found washed up on the island. I got some breakfast, fresh conch, coconut  water</p>

<p>and some leftover berries from yesterday. After my meal  I continued exploring the island.
   From exploring around the island I determined that I am on an atoll. An ancient volcano
   was once on this very spot now sounded by a reef with a lagoon</p>

<p> in the middle where the rim of the volcano once stood. The volcano is long gone;
  It sank back into the sea over the melenneas. The day went by slowly. I spent my time
   exploring, gathering food and looking out at the ocean for any sign of help. </p>

<p>One day turned into three days, then a full week went by. Life became routine and mondaine.
I had plenty of food, water, and wood for fire and adjusting to life as a castaway became
 easier with each passing day. In survival class we were taught</p>

<p>to keep busy and focus on surviving  will help deal with sad feelings. I thought of all
   my family members and what they may be going through; by now they must think I'm dead
   and this makes me very sad. On the 22nd day I arose out of my sleep</p>

<p>to the sound of what sounded like a helicopter close by. I ran out of my cave and
  ran down to the beach. I could hear the unmistakable sound of a helicopter but I
  couldn't see anything. As I listened closely the noise was coming from the other</p>

<p>side of the island, beyond the trees and out of sight.If I cannot see them, then
  they cannot see me. I sprinted around the beach and into the woods to the other
  side of the island as fast as I could. When I got to the other side of the atoll I saw</p>

<p>the helicopter flying away in the opposite direction. My heart sank. In a last ditch
   effort I ran back to my camp and set the pile of wood on fire hoping that they may see
    the smoke, but the fire took too long to get going. </p>

<p>By the time the smoke started bellowing upwards to the sky, the helicopter was
  already over the horizon and out of sight. That night I cried and cried at the
  missed opportunity to be rescued. Cold and alone I cried myself to sleep.</p>
